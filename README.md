Teachmint android assessment

Dear evaluator,

I have added my secret key to this repository for seamless testing of various functionalities.

Although I was able to finish all the tasks, but, I was not able to add the functionality of room database, which was to have 15 repos in the database and show them if the network fails.

I have tried to keep my focus fully on the functionality part, so you might not find the UI upto the mark as of now.
